Counting

1. __Multiplication rule__ 	
	We perform a task, which can be broken into k independent steps. Each step can be complete d in  ![n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{k}][equation1] ways. Entire task can be completed in ![n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{k}][equation1].
2. __Addition rule__ 	
	If a task can be completed in k mutually exclusive ways, then ![N = n_{1}+n_{2}+...+n_{k}][equation2], where ![n_{i}][equation3] is the number of choices for the ![i_{th}][equation4] order.
3. __Permutation__ 	
	In general, the number of permutation of n objects is ![n!][equation5].
	
4. __Selection with Repetition__
	+ Ordered with repetition	
	There are ![n^{r}][equation11] ways to do an ordered r selection out of n objects
	+ Unordered with repetition
	
	
5. __Important equation__
	+ ![{n + 1\choose k}  =  {n\choose k}  +  {n\choose k-1}][equation6]
	+ ![{n\choose m}{m\choose r} = {n\choose r} + {n-r \choose m-r}][equation7]
	+ ![(x+y)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n\choose k}x^{n-k}y^{k}][equation8]
	+ ![(2)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n\choose k}][equation9]
	+ ![0^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n\choose k}(-1)^{k}][equation10]
